# 🛰 A Cooperative Costmap with Lifelong Learning for Multi-Robot Navigation

This repository accompanies the paper:

> **"A Cooperative Costmap with Lifelong Learning for Multi‑Robot Navigation"**  
> submitted to the **Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL) 2025**.

It contains the source code for simulating a warehouse-like environment where multiple AMRs perform missions while collaboratively building and adapting a costmap over time.

## 🧩 Key Features

- **Cooperative Perception**: Robots share obstacle observations to build a shared costmap.
- **Lifelong Learning**: Lambda values in the costmap are updated based on robot experience, improving navigation over time.
- **Dynamic Obstacles**: Obstacles appear and move across the map based on a Poisson process, simulating realistic warehouse traffic.
- **Mission Routing**: Robots are assigned missions (e.g., A→B→C→A) and dynamically replan when obstacles appear.
- **Real-time Visualization**: The PyQt5 GUI displays the environment map, shared perception map, f(t) decay curves, and mission statistics.
- **Flexible Simulation Speed**: Supports real-time and accelerated simulation via adjustable time scaling.

## 🚀 Installation

**Requirements:**

- Python 3.8+
- PyQt5
- matplotlib
- numpy

**Install dependencies:**

```bash
pip install pyqt5 matplotlib numpy
```

## 🛠️ How to Run

Launch the simulation by executing:

```bash
python main.py
```

**Optional:**

- You can provide a suffix to distinguish saved log files:

```bash
python main.py simulation1
```

- Use `--grid-only` to launch a minimal view (only GridMap without full GUI):

```bash
python main.py --grid-only
```

## 🖥️ GUI Overview

| Component                  | Description                                                              |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Grid Map View**           | Shows the actual environment with walls, dynamic obstacles, and robots. |
| **Shared Perception View**  | Displays robots' cooperative obstacle mapping and f(t)-based overlays.  |
| **Statistics Panel**        | Displays mission counts, route types, and completion rates.             |
| **Simulation Controls**     | Start/Stop, adjust time scale, and save mission logs.                    |
| **Static f(t) Graphs**       | Monitor decay behavior for specific key cells in real-time.             |

## 📊 Logging and Saving

During or after simulation:

- **Mission logs** (time, route type, journey time) are saved into CSV files inside the `logs/` folder.
- **Learned lambda values** for each cell are also stored automatically for post-analysis or reuse.

You can also **apply previously learned lambda values** to start the simulation with an already trained costmap.

---

## 📈 Learning Mechanism

- **Lambda Update**: When robots encounter obstacles or successfully pass through suspected areas, they adjust the decay rate (`lambda`) of f(t) accordingly.
- **Experience Grid**: Each robot internally tracks observations (IDEAL, OBSTACLE, AVOID, CHECKED, EXPLORED) to refine its model of the environment.
